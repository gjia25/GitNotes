# GitNotes
A web app to share and view crowdsourced notes

# What it does
Everyone knows how handy git is for collaborative computer projects, so why not use version control with class notes as well?
GitNotes is a platform that stores notes that can be uploaded by any student. Users can propose edits to those notes, where the differences between the notes and the changes suggested are clearly shown. The original owner of the notes can then choose to accept or reject such changes to improve its quality.
